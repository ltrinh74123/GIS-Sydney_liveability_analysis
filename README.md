# Sydney-Liveability-Analysis
For the assignment, we needed to gather and integrate several datasets in order to investigate the most ‘liveable’ suburb for a potential stakeholder to buy in Greater Sydney through calculation of a ‘liveability’ score which is a sigmoid function of each indivudal z-score for potential features that can influence it. We then turn our attention to just the City of Sydney for a more focussed analysis. 

Here, we looked used the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and associated parent areas to map out the suburbs. All the data were added into Pgadmin and were retreieved on juptyer notebook write SQL queries. Python was also used to modefiy the datasets. A report was produced from the results.

The function of the liveable score follows:
